⚠️ This is part of TheOdinProject, that helps me learn Web Development⚠️  
  
🧮Goal of this project: Create a website, where I can practice the exam questions for "Operating Systems"🧮  
⚡Difficulties: Started this right after learning about DOM manipulation, had problems with storing questions (but ended up saving them in the source code, which i hate)⚡  
📗What I've learned: DOM manipulation, randomisation in JS, CSs, handling lists in JS 📗
