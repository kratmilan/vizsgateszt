# vizsgateszt  
  
ðŸ§®Goal of this project: Create a website, where I can practice the exam questions for "Operating Systems"ðŸ§®  
  
âš¡Difficulties: Started this right after learning about DOM manipulation, had problems with storing questions (but ended up saving them in the source code, which i hate)âš¡  
  
ðŸ“—What I've learned: DOM manipulation, randomisation in JS, CSs, handling lists in JS ðŸ“—
